# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study

In the telecom industry, customers can choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. The telecommunications industry 
experiences an average 15-25% annual churn rate in this highly competitive market. Given that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer 
than to retain an existing one, customer retention has become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining highly profitable customers is the first business goal.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and
identify the main indicators of churn.
